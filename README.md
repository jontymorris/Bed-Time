# Bed-Time
Shuts down your Windows when it's bedtime 

## What it does
The script quietly runs in the background and will routinely check whether or not it is past your bed time. If it detects that it is past your bedtime a shutdown will be scheduled.

If you want to change the bedtime that the script uses (past 9:30pm on weekdays and past 11pm on weekends) then you will have to edit the is_bedtime function.

## Setup
It is recommended that you make this script run at Startup either by adding it to the Startup folder or by adding it through the Task Scheduler application.
