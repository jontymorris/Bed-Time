# Bed-Time
Automatically shutdown your Windows compter when it's past your bed time

## What it does
The script quietly runs in the background and will routinely check whether or not it is past your bed time. If it detects that it is past your bedtime a shutdown will be scheduled.

## Setup
It is recommended that you make this script run at Startup either by adding it to the Startup folder or by adding it through the Task Scheduler application.
